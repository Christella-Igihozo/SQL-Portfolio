-- In this SQL code, I analyze AirBnB listings and reviews datasets from Vancouver, B.C. to understand potential revenue gained from investing in an airbnb and the best location in Vancouver.



 -- #1 How much did the top AirBnB earner make in 2022?

/** In a month **/
  
  Select top (20) 
  id, listing_url, name, property_type, neighbourhood_cleansed, room_type, accommodates, price, (30- availability_30) As Booked_30, price* (30-availability_30) AS Revenue_30
  FROM AirBnb.dbo.listings_new
  ORDER By Revenue_30 DESC

/** In a year **/

  Select top (20) 
  id, listing_url, name, property_type, neighbourhood_cleansed, room_type, accommodates, price, (365- availability_365) As Booked_365, price* (365-availability_365) AS Revenue_Per_Year
  FROM AirBnb.dbo.listings_new
  ORDER By Revenue_Per_Year DESC



-- #2 What are the property_type with listing price above average listing price per night?

 
SELECT  property_type, COUNT (property_type) AS num_above_avg_price
FROM AirBnb.dbo.listings_new
WHERE price >
 (SELECT AVG(price) FROM AirBnb.dbo.listings_new )
 GROUP BY  property_type
ORDER BY count(property_type) DESC



-- #3 What are the top 10 neighbourhood locations

SELECT TOP (10)
neighbourhood_cleansed, COUNT( neighbourhood_cleansed) As Popular_neighbourhood
FROM AirBnb.dbo.listings_new
GROUP BY neighbourhood_cleansed
ORDER BY Popular_neighbourhood DESC



-- #4 Which neighbourhood has reviews with good comments on location

SELECT 
listings_new.neighbourhood_cleansed, COUNT(listings_new.neighbourhood_cleansed) AS num_good_location_reviews
FROM dbo.reviews
INNER JOIN dbo.listings_new 
ON dbo.reviews.listing_id = dbo.listings_new.id
WHERE comments LIKE '% great location%' or comments like '%perfect Location%' or comments like '% ideal location%' or comments like '% convinient location%'
Group by listings_new.neighbourhood_cleansed
order by COUNT(listings_new.neighbourhood_cleansed) DESC
